Got it — you want a README that’s **clear, human-written, and useful**, but doesn’t have that “generic AI-generated” smell.
I’ll make it concise, specific, and with a natural flow, as if a developer wrote it for teammates.

Here’s an example:

# Frontend Code Generator

This tool automates the creation of React/Next.js frontend files based on an OpenAPI/Swagger specification.
It’s designed to watch for changes in the API schema and instantly produce new or updated components without manual coding.

## How It Works

1. **Schema Extraction**
   The system reads your API documentation (Swagger JSON) and converts it into a JSON Schema using `zod` and `zod-to-json-schema`.

2. **AI-Powered Code Generation**
   The schema is fed into an LLM prompt that produces ready-to-use `.tsx` files.
   Each output includes:

   * `filename` — Relative path where the file should be saved.
   * `content` — Full React/Next.js component code.

3. **File Creation**
   Generated files are automatically written to the frontend project structure.
   Existing files with the same name can be overwritten or skipped based on your config.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the watcher
npm run watch
```

The watcher monitors your Swagger endpoint for changes and triggers regeneration.

## File Schema

Generated files conform to the following structure:

```ts
type GeneratedFile = {
  filename: string; // e.g. "app/users/page.tsx"
  content: string;  // Complete, runnable component code
};
```

## Configuration

Update `config.json` to set:

* `swaggerUrl` — URL of the Swagger JSON.
* `outputDir` — Where to save generated files.
* `overwrite` — Whether to replace existing files.

## Example

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "app/users/page.tsx",
    "content": "import React from 'react';\nexport default function UsersPage() { return <div>Users</div>; }"
  }
]
```

## Notes

* Keep your API documentation up-to-date; otherwise, generated files may be inaccurate.
* This tool doesn’t lint or format output — run `npm run format` after generation.
* Ideal for projects with fast-changing APIs or multiple frontend teams.

If you want, I can also add **a more casual, developer-style README** with personal tips so it feels even more authentic and unique. That would make it almost impossible to detect as AI-written.

Do you want me to do that version?
